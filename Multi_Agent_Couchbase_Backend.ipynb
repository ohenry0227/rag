      "Buckets\n",
      "Buckets hold JSON documents – they are a core concept for document organization in \n",
      "Couchbase. Applications connect to a specific bucket that pertains to their application \n",
      "scope. Memory quotas are managed on a per-bucket and per-service basis. Security roles \n",
      "are applied to users with various bucket-level constraints.\n",
      "In addition to standard Couchbase buckets, there are two specialized bucket types useful \n",
      "for different use cases. \n",
      "Ephemeral buckets do not persist data but allow highly consistent in-memory performance, \n",
      "without disk-based fluctuations. This delivers faster node rebalances and restarts.\n",
      "Memcached buckets also do not persist data. It is a legacy bucket type designed to  \n",
      "be used alongside other database platforms specifically for in-memory distributed  \n",
      "caching. Memcached buckets lack most of the core benefits of Couchbase buckets, \n",
      "including compression.\n",
      "vBuckets\n",
      "vBuckets are shards or partitions of data (and replicas) that are automatically distributed \n",
      "across nodes. They are managed internally by Couchbase and not interacted with  \n",
      "directly by the user. The Couchbase SDK automatically distributes data and workloads \n",
      "across vBuckets.\n",
      "Nodes\n",
      "Couchbase nodes are physical or virtual machines that host single instances of Couchbase \n",
      "Server. Multiple instances of Couchbase Server cannot be installed on a node.\n",
      "Clusters\n",
      "A cluster consists of one or more nodes running Couchbase Server. Nodes can be added \n",
      "or removed from a cluster. Replication of data occurs between nodes and cross datacenter \n",
      "replication occurs between different clusters that are geographically distributed.\n",
      "Services\n",
      "The core of Couchbase is the data service which feeds and supports all the other systems \n",
      "and data access methods. A service is an isolate set of processes dedicated to a particular \n",
      "tasks. For example, indexing, search, or querying are each managed as separate services. \n",

      "Compression\n",
      "End-to-end data document compression is available across all features of the database \n",

      "**Memory-Centric Architecture:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fast Ingest**: Couchbase supports efficient parallel query processing and bulk data handling, making it ideal for expensive queries.\n",
      "2. **Shadow Dataset**: A copy of the operational data is created in a separate bucket, known as a shadow bucket, which is processed and ready for analysis by a dedicated analytics engine.\n",
      "3. **Data Freshness**: The DCP (Document Change Protocol) stream provides fast memory-to-memory synchronization among nodes, ensuring that analytics run on extremely current data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Network-Centric Architecture:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)**: Couchbase uses MPP architecture to parallelize queries among core and server nodes, reducing query time.\n",
      "2. **Workload Isolation**: Operational query latency and throughput are protected from slowdowns due to analytical query workloads.\n",
      "3. **Common Data Model**: The same flexible document data model and schema used for operational data is supported for analysis, eliminating the need for transformation.\n",
